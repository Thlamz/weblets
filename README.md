# Weblets
This is a repository for weblets. They are very small experiments, games and ideas that are not big enough to be something on their own, so I bring them to life here!

## Ping
Ping is a small web mini-game/experiment. The objective is to have the highest latency! Current latency is tracked and new high scores are saved in the leaderboard. Anything is allowed, from using a VPN to unplugging your router, try to be creative to win! Latency is measured as the two-way travel time of a message between the server and the client.

## Go away
This is a very temperamental website, you should probably not access it anyway

**If you must, it is available at https://thlamz.github.io/weblets/go-away/
