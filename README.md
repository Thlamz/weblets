# Weblets
This is a repository for weblets. They are very small experiments, games and ideas that are not big enough to be something on their own, so I bring them to life here! My intention is to explore different web technologies to build these small experiences. I'm avoiding the use of frameworks or bundlers and keeping dependencies restricted to absolute necessity or strong convenience, these are small projects and I intent to keep them that way.

## Ping
Ping is a small web mini-game/experiment. The objective is to have the highest latency! Current latency is tracked and new high scores are saved in the leaderboard. Anything is allowed, from using a VPN to unplugging your router, try to be creative to win! Latency is measured as the two-way travel time of a message between the server and the client.
